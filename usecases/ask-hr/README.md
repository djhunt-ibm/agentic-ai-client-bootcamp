One of the main challenges faced by any big organization is their HR operations management. As companies grow in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to get information faster and execute tasks with ease. With the advent of Agentic systems, and the power or reasoning models, it becomes easier to have a single entry point for doing mostly every HR operation.

## 🤔 The Problem

TechCorp Inc., a global IT leader with a workforce of 100,000 employees, faced a significant challenge in managing its growing HR operations. As the company expanded, it struggled with efficiently handling employee profile data, time-off requests, and workforce management. Traditional HR systems were no longer sufficient to keep up with the scale and complexity. With multiple vendor tools used for different HR operations, it is difficult to integrate all of them together and provide a seamless experience to the user.


## 🎯 Objective

With this use case, we are planning to tackle the challenge by adopting an enterprise-grade platform, watsonx, equipped with Agentic capabilities.
In this lab, we will see how the out-of-the-box prebuilt skills in watsonx Orchestrate can connect to HR management tools such as Workday, SuccessFactors, etc., or create custom skills to connect to any such systems easily. With watsonx.ai's agent driven insights, let's help TechCorp fast-track information retrieval, reduce administrative overhead, and ensure a more efficient and effective workforce.


## 📈 Business value

The usage of an AI-backed system to optimize the HR process can have multi-dimensional impacts, such as quicker resolution time, higher user satisfaction, increased revenue, and reduction in employee burnout, which ultimately positively impacts your business value. On the other hand, leveraging the Agentic capablities will come with its own additional set of values viz, improved data safety, and more grounded responses without hallucinations, thereby improving brand experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lab uses a simulator for a Human Capital Management system. However, this could be easily changed to any real system running in production such as Workday or others.
