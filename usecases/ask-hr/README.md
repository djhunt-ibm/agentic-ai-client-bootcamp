One of the main challenges faced by any big organization is the HR operation management. As companies grow in size, it would be come increasingly difficult to get to the information faster and execute things with ease. With the advent of Agentic systems, and the power or reasoning models, it becomes easier to have a single entry point for doing mostly every HR operations.


## The Problem

TechCorp Inc., a global IT leader with a workforce of 100,000 employees, faced a significant challenge in managing its growing HR operations. As the company expanded, it struggled with efficiently handling employee profile data, time-off and workforce management. Traditional HR systems were no longer sufficient to keep up with the scale and complexity. With multiple vendor tools used for different HR operations, it is difficult to integrate all of them together and to provide a seamless experience to the user.


## Objective

With this use-case, we are planning to tackle such a challenge by adopting an enterprise-grade platform, watsonx, equipped with Agentic capabilities.
In this lab, we will see how the out-of-the-box prebuilt skills  in watsonx.orchestrate can connect to HR management tools viz Workday, Successfactors etc or create custom skills to connect to any such systems easily. With watsonx.ai's agent driven insights let's see how TechCorp was able to fast-track information retrieval, reduce administrative overhead, and ensure a more efficient and effective management of its vast workforce.


## Business value

The usage of an AI backed system to optimize the HR process can have multi-dimensional impacts. Starting from quick resolution time, high user satisfaction, increased revenue, reducing employee burnout, this can have huge business value. On the other hand, leveraging the agentic capablities will come with its own additional set of values viz, improved data safety, more grounded responses without hallucinations and there by improved brand experience.
