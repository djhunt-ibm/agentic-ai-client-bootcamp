# Sales Configurator

The Sales Configurator use case is about an Agentic AI poswered assistant for a cloud and server provider (we are assuming IBM in this example) that helps understanding the challenges and requirments of cusotmers as they are looking to build a new solution or upgrade what they have. It simulates how a business might use AI agents to improve interactions with the customers, solution architects' job in gathering business and workload requirements, and information retrieval using a catalog.


## ü§î The Problem


The complexity and inefficiency of gathering customer requirements for various solutions such as cloud, server, or hybrid cloud configurations can be challenging due to the diverse range of customers, from non-technical to technical, and the need to adapt to their varying needs. The manual process of gathering requirements can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and delays, resulting in a poor experience for both customers and Solution Architects. Moreover, this labor-intensive process can be time-consuming, taking up valuable time that could be spent on higher-value tasks. The solution aims to simplify and streamline this process, reducing the time spent on requirements gathering and making it more efficient and effective for all parties involved.

## üéØ Objective

The primary objective is to build an Agenitc Solution that empowers a cloud and server provider to expedite their solution configuration processes, leveraging AI-driven automation, data aggregation at scale, and collaborative workflows. By unlocking actionable insights and streamlining configuration, this cutting-edge solution fuels business agility, productivity, and innovation.
