## Introduction  

![Architecture](assets/architecture.png)  

## Use Case Description

The sales department of ABC Motor Corp, an automotive large player, when preparing sales proposals, they were spending a lot of time understanding the features of competing products and comparing them with their own products. ABC Motor Corp, needs an automated competitive analysis system to help their sales teams quickly identify and position their products against competitors. Traditionally, gathering competitor insights required extensive manual research, making it inefficient and prone to outdated information. Therefore, the goal of this use case is to create an AI enabled system that support the customer's competitive analysis and market research.

## Adding Custom Skill 

After your instructor has completed the **Product APP** setup, request the server URL from them. Open the [OPEN_API_SPEC File](open_api_spec.json) and replace the default server URL with the one provided.

Note before starting the Agent creation make sure you have generated your project Id and API key refer [api_key_project_id_setup.md](http:)

## Agent Creation  
We will create three agents as part of this setup:  
1. **Link Search Agent**  
2. **Comparison Agent**  

Let's start with the **Link Search Agent**.     

### Link Search Agent  
#### Setup  
- Enter a **name** for the agent as shown in the image.  
- Add a **description** (optional).  

![Setup](assets/setup_link_search_agent.png)  

#### Configuration  
- Enter the **Instructions** as shown in the image. These instructions guide your agent on what tasks it should perform.  
- Choose **LangGraph** as the framework.  
- Select **ReAct** as the architecture.  

![Configuration](images/configuration_link_search_agent.png)  

#### Tools  
- Select **Google Search** as the tool to gather data.  

![Tool](images/tool_link_search_agent.png)  

Once the agent is created, test it on the right-hand side of the chat section, as shown in the image below.  

Click on the **Save As** button to save your agent (marked as number 1 in the image). Then, click on the **Deploy** button to deploy the agent (marked as number 2 in the image). Deployment may take 1-2 minutes.

## Getting the Space ID for Deployment on Code Engine

To deploy your agent on Code Engine, follow the steps available in instruct lab how to deploy your agents to get your Space ID:

### Space ID

1. Go to the home page of Agent Lab. 
![Home](images/home.png)   

2. Click the hamburger menu and choose Deployment.
![Deploment Selection](images/deployment.png)  

3. On the Deployment page, find Deployment Space and click on it.
![Spaces](images/spaces.png)  

4. Click on the Manage tab and copy your Space ID.
![Manage](images/manage.png) 

### Deployment

On the Deployment Space page, select the agent. It will take you to the deployment page, where you can get the Deployment ID.

![Deployment Space](images/deployments_space.png)

![URL Deployment](images/url_deployment.png)

Repeat the same step for all the agents, as shown in the image below

## Deploying Agents on Code Engine

Please refer to the [Code Engine instructor](https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp-instructors/blob/main/environment-setup/external-agent-builder/Readme.md) guide for deployment instructions. Once you obtain the deployment link, kindly open it.

You will reach the page shown in the image below. Follow these two steps to generate the Bearer Token:

1. Enter the Deployment ID and Space ID, then click on the Generate Token button.
![Token generator](images/token_generation.png)

2. Copy the Bearer Token.
![Generated Token](images/generated_token.png)

The Space ID remains constant for all agents, but each Deployment ID has a unique Bearer Token.

Repeat these steps for all the remaining agents to get their respective Bearer Tokens.

## Agent Descriptions

1. Link Search Agent: This agent is an expert in finding URLs or links for similar products that share matching features, ensuring users can explore alternatives efficiently.

2. Comparison Agent: This agent is designed to compare the given data with additional information gathered from Google search results. Its task is to carefully analyze the input data, extract key insights, and identify both differences and similarities. The findings should be presented in a well-structured table format, making it easy to understand and compare the information at a glance.

After completing the integration, your flow will appear as shown below.
