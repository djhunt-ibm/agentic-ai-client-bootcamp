## üèõ Architecture  

<img width="900" alt="image" src="assets/Business_Automation_Architecture.png">

## Use Case Description

The sales department of ABC Motor Corp, an automotive large player, when preparing sales proposals, they were spending a lot of time understanding the features of competing products and comparing them with their own products. ABC Motor Corp, needs an automated competitive analysis system to help their sales teams quickly identify and position their products against competitors. Traditionally, gathering competitor insights required extensive manual research, making it inefficient and prone to outdated information. Therefore, the goal of this use case is to create an AI enabled system that support the customer's competitive analysis and market research.

Your task is to analyse and compare products on the following features strictly: Range, Pricing, Acceleration, Top Speed, Interior and Safety Features If a feature is not applicable, mark it as N/A. Additionally, perform a SWOT analysis of top products (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) Present the comparison in 3 tables one for the comparison , second for the rating numerical rating (X/5) and a star rating (‚òÖ out of ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) for each feature  and  third for the SWOT analysis. Give heading to each table . After every table give two divider.

   Instructions:

   ```
   This agent is designed to search for a specified product and retrieve its details and features using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the product catalog. It presents the information in a clear and structured format, ensuring systematic organization of key product data, making it easy to understand and use.
   ```
   ![Create from scratch](assets/product_scratch.png)

4. After the agent is created, navigate to the Agent Configuration page.

   **Description:**
   ```
   Your knowledge base is the document that contains all the product-related information. All queries related to the product will be addressed using this document as the primary source.
   ```
   ![Knowledge](assets/product_knowledge.png)

5. Scroll down to the Knowledge section, then in the Document section, click on the Upload file button nad upload the product catalog.
![Upload file](assets/upload_file.png)

![Add from local instance](assets/product_add_pop_up.png)

> **Note:** : We are now adding the Link Search Agent (an external agent) and the Comparison Agent to the Product Agent, enabling it to delegate tasks to them.

8. Then, select the Comparison Agent (as shown in image 1) and the Link Search Agent [External Agent] (as shown in image 2). After selecting both, click the Add to agent button to include them (as shown in image 3).
![Delegation Agent](assets/delegation.png)

      For Product Agent use the below description in Behavior Section.

      ```
      This agent is responsible for handling product-related queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the product catalog.

      For general product queries, it retrieves structured information directly from the knowledge base.

      For queries involving URLs or web references, it delegates the task to the Link Search Agent.

      For product comparison queries, it forwards the request to the Comparison Agent.

      This delegation ensures that each query type is handled by the most suitable agent, improving accuracy and efficiency.
      ```
      ![Behavior](assets/Product_agent_deploy.png)

> **Note:** : The Product Agent is now ready to handle product-related queries, delegating tasks to the Link Search Agent and Comparison Agent as needed.

## Experience Agents in Action
Follow the steps above, then try interacting with the use case using these sample queries:

1. Product Agent

   Ask the following questions to get responses from the Product Agent:
   ```
   Q1: What are the products of ABC Motors.
   Q2: Get me the info of Velocity S1.
   ```
   ![Skill Response](assets/chat_1.png)  

2. Link Search Agent

   Use this query to retrieve competitor links:
   ```
   Provide me the links of 4 competitors of above product.
   ```
   ![Link Search Agent Response](assets/chat_2_skill.png)

3. Comparison Agent

   To compare the retrieved data, ask:
   ```
   Give me the comparison of above data.
   ```
