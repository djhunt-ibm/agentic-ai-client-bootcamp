<img alt="Order-to-Cash" src="./practitioner_docs/order2cash/o2c.png" width="1000">

One of the critical processes in any enterprise is the Order-to-Cash (O2C) cycle, which spans order placement, invoicing, and payment collection. As businesses scale, managing this workflow manually becomes time-consuming and prone to delays. By simulating interactions with the O2C system and leveraging automation, organizations can streamline order processing, accelerate invoice generation, and ensure timely payment collection. With the rise of Agentic systems and intelligent reasoning models, automating the entire O2C flow not only boosts operational efficiency but also enhances customer satisfaction through faster, more reliable service delivery.
