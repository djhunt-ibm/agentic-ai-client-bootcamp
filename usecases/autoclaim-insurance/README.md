# Auto Insurance Claim Processing with Agentic AI

## Introduction: 
Greetings introduce you to WatsonxAutoClaims, a revolutionary digital platform that transforms the auto insurance claim process through the power of Agentic AI.
Traditionally, filing an insurance claim is a tedious, manual, and often frustrating process. Customers struggle with complex paperwork, poor communication, and long wait times, while claim reviewers are burdened with data overload, fraud detection challenges, and regulatory compliance.
But what if we could change that? What if we could make claims processing seamless, intelligent, and highly efficient? That’s exactly what WatsonxAutoClaims delivers!

## Problem Statement: 
Let’s take a quick look at the challenges faced by both customers and claim reviewers in the current process:
### Customers experience:
  - A complicated, time-consuming claim submission process.
  - Lack of communication and transparency.
  - Delayed settlements due to manual processing.
  - Unclear understanding of policy coverage.

### Claim Reviewers face:
