# Auto-Insurance claim automation with Agentic AI 

![](insurance-banner.png)



##  🤔 The Problem

ABC Insurance agency is a pioneer in Auto-insurance. While ABC Insurance has long led the way in auto coverage, its legacy systems and fragmented workflows have created a cumbersome experience for both **customers** and **claim processors**. Customers often face long wait times, confusing paperwork, and limited visibility into their claim status. Meanwhile, claim processors are bogged down by manual data entry, siloed information, and the increasing challenge of identifying fraud—all while striving to stay compliant.
