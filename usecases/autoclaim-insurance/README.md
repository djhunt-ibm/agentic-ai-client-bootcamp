### For Claim Processors & Insurers POV

#### **AI-Driven Claim Prioritization**

* **Automated sorting**: AI evaluates claims for urgency, complexity, and risk factors, then categorizes them based on predefined business rules. Claims with high value, high urgency, or those suspected of being fraudulent are flagged for immediate review.

* **Cross-referencing with existing data**: AI cross-references claim information with previous claims and customer profiles to detect any inconsistencies or anomalies that may require further investigation.

#### **Smart Claim Assessment & Recommendations**

* **Structured decision support**: For each claim, the system analyzes key factors such as policy terms, claim history, and incident specifics to generate well-supported recommendations. The AI suggests whether a claim should be **approved**, **rejected**, or **escalated** to a higher authority.
* **Data-driven rationale**: Along with each recommendation, the AI provides a clear and concise rationale, outlining the factors considered (e.g., policy limits, prior claims, damages). This enables reviewers to make confident, data-backed decisions.
* **Fair settlement predictions**: For straightforward claims, the system suggests an estimated settlement amount based on historical data, ensuring consistency and fairness in payout decisions.

#### **Faster Dispute Resolution**
